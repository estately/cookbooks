# Description

A convenient Chef LWRP to manage user accounts and SSH keys. This is **not**
the Opscode *users* cookbook.

# Requirements

## Chef

Tested on 0.10.2 but newer and older version should work just fine. File an
[issue][issues] if this isn't the case.

## Platform

The following platforms have been tested with this cookbook, meaning that the
recipes run on these platforms without error:

* ubuntu
* debian
* mac_os_x

## Cookbooks

There are **no** external cookbook dependencies.

# Installation

Depending on the situation and use case there are several ways to install
this cookbook. All the methods listed below assume a tagged version release
is the target, but omit the tags to get the head of development. A valid
Chef repository structure like the [Opscode repo][chef_repo] is also assumed.

## From the Opscode Community Platform

To install this cookbook from the Opscode platform, use the *knife* command:

    knife cookbook site install user

## Using Librarian

The [Librarian][librarian] gem aims to be Bundler for your Chef cookbooks.
Include a reference to the cookbook in a **Cheffile** and run
`librarian-chef install`. To install with Librarian:

    gem install librarian
    cd chef-repo
    librarian-chef init
    cat >> Cheffile <<END_OF_CHEFFILE
    cookbook 'user',
      :git => 'git://github.com/fnichol/chef-user.git', :ref => 'v0.2.6'
    END_OF_CHEFFILE
    librarian-chef install

## Using knife-github-cookbooks

The [knife-github-cookbooks][kgc] gem is a plugin for *knife* that supports
installing cookbooks directly from a GitHub repository. To install with the
plugin:

    gem install knife-github-cookbooks
    cd chef-repo
    knife cookbook github install fnichol/chef-user/v0.2.6

## As a Git Submodule

A common practice (which is getting dated) is to add cookbooks as Git
submodules. This is accomplishes like so:

    cd chef-repo
    git submodule add git://github.com/fnichol/chef-user.git cookbooks/user
    git submodule init && git submodule update

**Note:** the head of development will be linked here, not a tagged release.

## As a Tarball

If the cookbook needs to downloaded temporarily just to be uploaded to a Chef
Server or Opscode Hosted Chef, then a tarball installation might fit the bill:

    cd chef-repo/cookbooks
    curl -Ls https://github.com/fnichol/chef-user/tarball/v0.2.6 | tar xfz - && \
      mv fnichol-chef-user-* user

# Usage

Simply include `recipe[user]` in your run_list and the `user_account`
resource will be available.

To use `recipe[user::data_bag]`, include it in your run_list and have a
data bag called `"users"` with an item like the following:

    {
      "id"        : "hsolo",
      "comment"   : "Han Solo",
      "home"      : "/opt/hoth/hsolo",
      "ssh_keys"  : ["123...", "456..."]
    }

or a user to be removed:

    {
      "id"      : "lando",
      "action"  : "remove"
    }

The data bag recipe will iterate through a list of usernames defined in
`node['users']` and attempt to pull in the user's information from the data
bag item. In other words, having:

    node['users'] = ['hsolo']

will set up the `hsolo` user information and not use the `lando` user
information.

# Recipes

## default

This recipe is a no-op and does nothing.

## data_bag

Processes a list of users with data drawn from a data bag. The default data bag
is `users` and the list of user account to create on this node is set on
`node['users']`.

# Attributes

## `home_root`

The default parent path of a user's home directory. Each resource can override
this value which varies by platform. Generally speaking, the default value is
`"/home"`.

## `default_shell`

The default user shell given to a user. Each resource can override this value
which varies by platform. Generally speaking, the default value is
`"/bin/bash"`.

## `manage_home`

Whether of not to manage the home directory of a user by default. Each resource
can override this value. The are 2 valid states:

* `"true"`, `true`, or `"yes"`: will manage the user's home directory.
* `"false"`, `false`, or `"no"`: will not manage the user's home directory.

The default is `true`.

## `create_user_group`

Whether or not to to create a group with the same name as the user by default.
Each resource can override this value. The are 2 valid states:

* `"true"`, `true`, or `"yes"`: will create a group for the user by default.
* `"false"`, `false`, or `"no"`: will create a group for the user by default.

The default is `true`.

## `ssh_keygen`

Whether or not to generate an SSH keypair for the user by default. Each
resource can override this value. There are 2 valid states:

* `"true"`, `true`, or `"yes"`: will generate an SSH keypair when the account
  is created.
* `"false"`, `false`, or `"no"`: will generate an SSH keypair when the account
  is created.

The default is `true`.

## `data_bag`

The data bag name containing a group of user account information. This is used
by the `data_bag` recipe to use as a database of user accounts. The default is
`"users"`.
