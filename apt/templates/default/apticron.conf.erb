# set EMAIL to a space separated list of addresses which will be notified of
# impending updates
#
EMAIL="<%= node.apt.notification_email %>"

#
# Set DIFF_ONLY to "1" to only output the difference of the current run
# compared to the last run (ie. only new upgrades since the last run). If there
# are no differences, no output/email will be generated. By default, apticron
# will output everything that needs to be upgraded.
#
# DIFF_ONLY="1"

#
# Set LISTCHANGES_PROFILE if you would like apticron to invoke apt-listchanges
# with the --profile option. You should add a corresponding profile to
# /etc/apt/listchanges.conf
#
# LISTCHANGES_PROFILE="apticron"

#
# Set SYSTEM if you would like apticron to use something other than the output
# of "hostname -f" for the system name in the mails it generates
#
# SYSTEM="foobar.example.com"

#
# Set IPADDRESSNUM if you would like to configure the maximal number of IP
# addresses apticron displays. The default is to display 1 address of each
# family type (inet, inet6), if available.
#
# IPADDRESSNUM="1"

#
# Set IPADDRESSES to a whitespace separated list of reachable addresses for
# this system. By default, apticron will try to work these out using the
# "ip" command
#
# IPADDRESSES="192.0.2.1 2001:db8:1:2:3::1"

#
# Set NOTIFY_HOLDS="0" if you don't want to be notified about new versions of
# packages on hold in your system. The default behavior is downloading and
# listing them as any other package.
#
# NOTIFY_HOLDS="0"

#
# Set CUSTOM_SUBJECT if you want to replace the default subject used in
# the notification e-mails. This may help filtering/sorting client-side e-mail.
#
# CUSTOM_SUBJECT=""
