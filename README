Estately's Own Chef Cookbooks
========================================================================
Proper README coming soon, but in the meantime please check the READMEs
in individual cookbook directories.

Note: these cookbooks are very opinionated. You should be running a Chef
server and your nodes should be running 64-bit Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.
